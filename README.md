Currently, this node editor allows users to define basic scene data, and connect them to other scenes.
This is useful for defining entrances and exits in scenes for your game in order to easily see how your game world flows.

For example: If your making an RPG, you may have a simple setup like this `Town -> Field -> Town2 -> Dungeon`

Afterwards, you can export the data as a json file so you can import it into your favorite game engine or application!
